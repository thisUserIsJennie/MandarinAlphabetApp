# Welcome to the Mandarin Alphabet Web App!

Hello! I'm Jennie, the developer responsible for this repository.

I created this app to learn React.js and Javascript/HTML/CSS, and to demonstrate my propensity for modular, well commented code.

The Mandarin Alphabet web app is a platform to help people learn Zhuyin, which is a valuable tool in learning to speak, read, and write Mandarin Chinese. 
Currently, there is only one page in this application, which contains all the Zhuyin characters and how to pronounce them (including audio). But fear not, I have a vision for expanding upon its current capabilities! Eventually this app will include an interactive keyboard for forming Mandarin words using Zhuyin, quiz capabilities, and more!

# Technologies Used

This web application was created using React.js, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

The audio files for prounouncing Zhuyin characters were generated using Node.js and Google Cloud's Text-To-Speech API (see TextToSpeech.js).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
